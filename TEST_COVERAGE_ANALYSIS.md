# Test Coverage Analysis: Achieving 100% Coverage

This document details the additional tests written to achieve 100% code coverage for the Laravel 12 starter kit, explaining the reasoning behind each test and the specific code paths they cover.

## Overview

- **Initial Coverage**: 90.1%
- **Final Coverage**: 100.0%
- **Tests Added**: 5 new tests
- **Coverage Driver**: PCOV extension

## Coverage Analysis Before Implementation

The coverage report identified 4 areas with incomplete coverage:

| Component | Initial Coverage | Missing Lines | Issue |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| `EmailVerificationNotificationController` | 0.0% | All lines | No tests existed |
| `EmailVerificationPromptController` | 66.7% | Line 20 | Missing verified user path |
| `VerifyEmailController` | 80.0% | Line 20 | Missing already-verified user path |
| `LoginRequest` | 65.2% | Lines 69-78 | Missing rate limiting logic |

## Tests Written

### 1. EmailVerificationNotificationController Tests

**Files Modified**: `tests/Feature/Auth/EmailVerificationTest.php`

#### Test 1: `email verification notification can be sent for unverified user`

```php
test('email verification notification can be sent for unverified user', function (): void {
    $user = User::factory()->unverified()->create();

    $response = $this->actingAs($user)->post('/email/verification-notification');

    $response->assertRedirect();
    $response->assertSessionHas('status', 'verification-link-sent');
});
```

**Why**: Tests the primary happy path where an unverified user requests a verification email.

**Coverage**: Lines 22-24 in `EmailVerificationNotificationController::store()`
- `$request->user()->sendEmailVerificationNotification()`
- `return back()->with('status', 'verification-link-sent')`

#### Test 2: `email verification notification redirects verified user to dashboard`

```php
test('email verification notification redirects verified user to dashboard', function (): void {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $response = $this->actingAs($user)->post('/email/verification-notification');

    $response->assertRedirect(route('dashboard', absolute: false));
});
```

**Why**: Tests the edge case where an already verified user tries to request another verification email.

**Coverage**: Lines 18-19 in `EmailVerificationNotificationController::store()`
- `if ($request->user()->hasVerifiedEmail())`
- `return redirect()->intended(route('dashboard', absolute: false))`

### 2. EmailVerificationPromptController Test

#### Test: `email verification prompt redirects verified user to dashboard`

```php
test('email verification prompt redirects verified user to dashboard', function (): void {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $response = $this->actingAs($user)->get('/verify-email');

    $response->assertRedirect(route('dashboard', absolute: false));
});
```

**Why**: The existing test only covered unverified users seeing the verification view. This tests what happens when a verified user accesses the verification prompt.

**Coverage**: Line 20 in `EmailVerificationPromptController::__invoke()`
- `redirect()->intended(route('dashboard', absolute: false))` branch of the ternary operator

**Note**: The existing test covered line 21 (the `view('auth.verify-email')` branch).

### 3. VerifyEmailController Test

#### Test: `email verification succeeds for already verified user`

```php
test('email verification succeeds for already verified user', function (): void {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    $verificationUrl = URL::temporarySignedRoute(
        'verification.verify',
        now()->addMinutes(60),
        ['id' => $user->id, 'hash' => sha1((string) $user->email)]
    );

    $response = $this->actingAs($user)->get($verificationUrl);

    $response->assertRedirect(route('dashboard', absolute: false) . '?verified=1');
});
```

**Why**: Tests the edge case where an already verified user clicks a verification link (perhaps from an old email).

**Coverage**: Lines 19-20 in `VerifyEmailController::__invoke()`
- `if ($request->user()->hasVerifiedEmail())`
- `return redirect()->intended(route('dashboard', absolute: false) . '?verified=1')`

**Note**: The existing test covered the main verification flow (lines 23-27) for unverified users.

### 4. LoginRequest Rate Limiting Test

#### Test: `login is rate limited after too many failed attempts`

```php
test('login is rate limited after too many failed attempts', function (): void {
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    
    // Make 5 failed login attempts to trigger rate limiting
    for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
        $this->post('/login', [
            'email' => $user->email,
            'password' => 'wrong-password',
        ]);
    }
    
    // The 6th attempt should trigger rate limiting
    $response = $this->post('/login', [
        'email' => $user->email,
        'password' => 'wrong-password',
    ]);
    
    $response->assertSessionHasErrors(['email']);
    $this->assertGuest();
});
```

**Why**: Tests the rate limiting mechanism that prevents brute force attacks. The existing tests only covered successful and single failed login attempts.

**Coverage**: Lines 69-78 in `LoginRequest::ensureIsNotRateLimited()`
- `event(new Lockout($this))`
- `$seconds = RateLimiter::availableIn($this->throttleKey())`
- `throw ValidationException::withMessages([...])`

**How it works**: 
1. Laravel's `RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts()` returns `false` for the first 5 attempts
2. On the 6th attempt, it returns `true`, triggering the rate limiting logic
3. A `Lockout` event is fired
4. A `ValidationException` is thrown with the throttle message

## Testing Methodology

### Factory Usage
- **Verified Users**: `User::factory()->create()` - Creates users with `email_verified_at` set to current time
- **Unverified Users**: `User::factory()->unverified()->create()` - Creates users with `email_verified_at` set to `null`

### URL Generation
- Used `URL::temporarySignedRoute()` to create valid verification links
- Followed existing patterns from the codebase for route names and parameters

### Assertions
- **Redirects**: Used `assertRedirect()` with specific route URLs
- **Session Data**: Used `assertSessionHas()` to verify flash messages
- **Errors**: Used `assertSessionHasErrors()` for validation failures
- **Authentication**: Used `assertGuest()` to ensure failed logins don't authenticate users

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **Double Verification**: What happens when already verified users try to verify again
2. **Stale Links**: Verified users clicking old verification emails
3. **Rate Limiting**: Brute force attack prevention
4. **Notification Spam**: Verified users requesting more verification emails

## Benefits of 100% Coverage

1. **Confidence**: All code paths are tested, reducing bugs in production
2. **Regression Prevention**: Future changes won't break existing functionality
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation of expected behavior
4. **Security**: Rate limiting and authentication edge cases are verified
5. **Maintainability**: Changes can be made with confidence that tests will catch issues

## Tools Used

- **PCOV Extension**: Lightweight code coverage driver
- **Pest PHP**: Modern testing framework with clean syntax
- **Laravel Factories**: For creating test data
- **Laravel HTTP Testing**: For simulating HTTP requests

## Conclusion

By adding these 5 targeted tests, we achieved 100% code coverage while ensuring all authentication and email verification edge cases are properly handled. The tests follow Laravel and Pest best practices and provide comprehensive coverage of both happy paths and error conditions.
